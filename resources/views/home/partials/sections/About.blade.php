        <p>At Fridgeworthy, our goal is to incite academic success by rewarding the combined
            efforts of students, teachers, and parents. We know sometimes students need
            motivation to stay focused on their education, especially with so many other
            activities going on in their lives. We are here to remove that pressure from students,
            teachers, and parents. We want to make learning a fun, rewarding, and collaborative
            effort that engages the entire community. With our proud partners, we present exciting rewards that can be redeemed by Fridgeworthy members.</p>
