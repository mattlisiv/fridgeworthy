        <p>At FridgeWorthy, we seek to recognize academic success by rewarding the combined efforts of students, teachers, and parents.
            By rewarding studentsâ€™ academic success in the community, we build a support system that promotes individual growth for both students
            and teachers alike.  Through our unique program, students, teachers, and parents work together, along with local businesses, to build
            an environment of academic achievement and support.</p>
