            <p>
                There are certain types of information protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA restricts teachers and any other employee of an educational institution from sharing information directly identifiable to a student. This includes a students’ education records and any other similar record. There is certain information that may be provided to FridgeWorthy by school employees and officials that is considered directory information under FERPA, thus not considered an education record (i.e. Student names and grade levels). A student under the age of 18 may only enter information from their own student records (grades both numerical or letter), after their parent or legal guardian has consented for them to do so. The consent of parents and legal guardians has been previously detailed in these terms. FridgeWorthy will never share any education record entered by a student and directly identifiable with said student, with third parties.
